## Overview of the UFOs

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive website for UFO data. There is information about UFO sightings displayed in a table. The table can be filtered to narrow down the table data by Date, City, State, Country and Shape. 


## Results:

The UFO detail is listed in the Table selection at the right of the page.

Table data includes:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape
- Duration
- Comments

Filter options have been added to make searching for data easier. The user can filter only 1 field, or use several filters until reaching the desired information. In the image below I filtered State and Country, that is, I am locating all data from California in the United States.

The options are:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

Finally you the user can input the information and press enter, and the data will filter.

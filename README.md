# Module 11 Challenge

## Overview of the UFOs

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive website for UFO data. There is information about UFO sightings displayed in a table. The table can be filtered to narrow down the table data by Date, City, State, Country and Shape. 

Codes used:

[Index.html](https://github.com/lfhoepers/UFOs/blob/a580a1b7ed34d82f16bf091b6cfff030b10820ac/index.html)

[app.js](https://github.com/lfhoepers/UFOs/blob/a580a1b7ed34d82f16bf091b6cfff030b10820ac/static/js/app.js)

## Results:

The UFO detail is listed in the Table selection at the right of the page.

Table data includes:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape
- Duration
- Comments

Filter options have been added to make searching for data easier. The user can filter only 1 field, or use several filters until reaching the desired information. In the image below I filtered State and Country, that is, I am locating all data from California in the United States.

The options are:

- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape

Finally you the user can input the information and press enter, and the data will filter.

## Summary: 

- Drawback

The design drawback is mainly not having Search buttons. So to clear field you have to either clear and press enter or click on refresh.


- Recommendations

 A suggestion is to treat the case sensitive, so that the user does not need to type the data exactly as it is in the data field.
 
 The Second recommendation, I've already made, which are filter and clear fields precisely to help with the dynamics of the website. used the following code:

 I appreciate the opportunity to present this project, I am available for any clarification.
